The provided log content details an attempt to use `su` and `sudo` commands within a Termux environment on an Android device.

Here's a summary of the key findings from the log:

1.  **`su` command failure**: The `su` command explicitly states, "No su program found on this device. Termux does not supply tools for rooting..." This indicates that the Android device is not rooted, and therefore, superuser privileges cannot be obtained directly through `su`.
2.  **`sudo` (tsu wrapper)**: Initially, the `sudo` command was a wrapper script provided by `tsu` (Termux su). This script is designed to interface with an existing `su` binary if one is present.
3.  **`sudo` (installed package)**: The user then installed `sudo_1.2.0_all.deb`, which replaced the `tsu` wrapper. The help output for this newly installed `sudo` command also describes it as "a wrapper script to execute commands as the 'root (superuser)' user in the Termux app." It relies on an underlying `su` program to function.

In conclusion, both the `su` command and the `sudo` wrappers observed in the log require the device to be rooted (i.e., have a functional `su` binary) to grant superuser privileges. Since the `su` command itself reports that no `su` program is found, the attempts to gain root access via these commands are unsuccessful because the device is not rooted.
