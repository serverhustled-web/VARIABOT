This script, `install_xsu.sh`, is designed to install a "Termux Superuser" utility named `xsu`.

Here's a breakdown of what the script does:

1.  **`banner_termux-superuser`**: Displays an ASCII art banner for "Termux Superuser" with author credits.
2.  **`check_update`**:
    *   Checks if the Termux environment is up-to-date by looking for the `~/.termux` directory.
    *   If it seems to be an older version, it attempts to update `apt` packages (`apt update`, `apt upgrade -y`) and installs `wget`.
    *   It then instructs the user to restart Termux and run the installation again.
3.  **`check_tbin`**:
    *   Ensures that the `~/.termux/bin` directory exists. If not, it creates it.
    *   It also adds `export PATH=$PATH:/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.termux/bin` to `~/.bashrc`, ensuring that executables placed in `~/.termux/bin` are in the user's PATH.
4.  **`clean_cipherus`**: Removes temporary files (`cipherus-libraries.sh`, `~/.wget-hsts`) if they exist.
5.  **`ibar`**: This is a simple progress bar function used to display installation progress. It also includes an integrity checker for the file it's monitoring.
6.  **`install_termux-superuser`**:
    *   Creates an executable file named `xsu` in `~/.termux/bin`.
    *   The `xsu` script's content is:
        ```bash
        #! /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash
        # This file starts termux in su with all termux binaries enabled
        su -c '
        xsu_env=$PATH:/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin
        xsu_env=$xsu_env:/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/applets
        xsu_env=$xsu_env:/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.termux/bin
        export PATH=$xsu_env; exec su'

        ```
    *   This `xsu` script essentially executes `su` (superuser) and, before doing so, sets up the `PATH` environment variable within the superuser shell to include Termux's binary directories, allowing Termux commands to be used directly in the root shell.
    *   It makes the `xsu` script executable (`chmod +x`).
    *   It then uses the `ibar` function to show progress for the `xsu` file creation.
    *   Finally, it prints a success message and instructs the user to restart Termux and run `xsu` to use the superuser functionality.

**In summary:** This script installs a wrapper (`xsu`) that allows you to easily switch to a root shell within Termux while retaining access to Termux's utilities and commands.

**To use it:**
1.  Run the `install_xsu.sh` script.
2.  If prompted to update Termux, follow the instructions to restart Termux and run the script again.
3.  After successful installation, restart your Termux application.
4.  Type `xsu` in your Termux terminal to enter a superuser shell.
