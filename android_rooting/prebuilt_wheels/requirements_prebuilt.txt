# Pre-built wheel requirements for Termux/Android ARM64
# These packages should be installed from pre-built wheels to avoid compilation issues

# Core numerical and data processing
numpy>=1.21.0
pandas>=1.5.0

# Image processing
Pillow>=8.0.0

# Security and cryptography
cryptography>=40.0.0

# System utilities (if pre-built wheels available)

# Optional: ML/AI packages (if needed and available)
# scikit-learn>=1.0.0
# tensorflow-lite>=2.10.0
# torch>=1.13.0  # Mobile/lite version

# Notes:
# 1. Install these using: pip install --find-links=./arm64 -r requirements_prebuilt.txt
# 2. Not all packages may have pre-built wheels - fallback to source if needed
# 3. Wheels must match: Python version, Android/Linux platform, ARM64 architecture
# 4. Update this list as new pre-built wheels become available
