Okay, I have confirmed that `torch` and `transformers` are installed. Now I will proceed with creating `aichat.py` by merging the functionalities of `local_chat.py` and `local_chat_interface.py`.

First, I need to read the content of both `local_chat.py` and `local_chat_interface.py` to perform the merge.

```tool_code
print(read_many_files(file_paths=['local_chat.py', 'local_chat_interface.py']))
```
